# Drip Intro

[Drip](https://drip.community) is a deflationary daily ROI platform that allows
you to earn 1% daily return on your investment sustainably through a tax system
on transactions. It also allows team building through a referral system, and most
importantly, compound interest. 


## The Faucet

The [Faucet](https://drip.community/faucet) is a low-risk, high reward contract that operates similar to a high yield 
certificate of deposit. You can participate by purchasing drip from the [swap page](https://drip.community/fountain).

It is necessary, depending on your deposit size, to compound up to several times a day. The purpose of this code
is to do this automatically for you so you don't have to. 

## Setup Autohydrater

This code was specifically written to be as secure as possible, since signing transactions requires the use of
a wallet's private key. It's imparative you use the encryption outlined in the code to best protect yourself
in the event your computer is ever compomised. 

1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you do not already have it. I was not able to get this code
to work on Python 3.9, so I would recommending using Python 3.7 or 3.8. There are a number of resources that will walk 
you through installing Python depending on your operating system.

2. Once Python is installed, the following packages need to be installed.

web3, cryptography, python-dotenv
 
```bash
$ python -m pip install web3
$ python -m pip install cryptography
$ python -m pip install python-dotenv
```

3. In a python terminal, import `cryptography` and encrypt your private key

```py
>>>import cryptography
>>>key = Fernet.generate_key()
>>>fernet = Fernet(key.encode())
>>>encMessage = fernet.encrypt('YOURKEYHERE'.encode())
>>>encMessage.decode()
```

4. Take the value in `encMessage`, create a file called `key.txt` and save the text in the file 

5. Open `.env.example` and replace the key with the key you generated in step 3. Save the file without .example at the end. 

6. Open the `hydrate.py` file and replace the string stored in `wallet_public_addr` with your own public wallet.

## Using the Autohydrater

In a terminal window, navigate to the location where you saved all the files. Run the `hydrate.py` file.

```bash
$ python hydrate.py
```

This terminal window will always need to remain open for the autohydrater to function. If the terminal window closes, just execute
`hydrate.py` again.

If this autohydrater helps you, consider supporting me by sending me an airdrop.
